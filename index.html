The reason they were attacking a fort in their own state was because it was occupied by the United States Army, who then returned fire. The bombardment started at 4:30, where a mortar was shot from Fort Johnson. The mortar then exploded over Sumter, which was the signal for the rest of their militia to begin the attack. The bombardment lasted until 1pm the next day, when they the United States army surrendered. This caused the start of the Civil War</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="content"><h4>July 21, 1861</h4><h3>First Battle of Bull Run</h3><p>The battle which was called the First Battle of Bull Run by the Union forces, and the First Battle of Manassas by the Confederate army, was the first major battle of the Civil War. It was fought in Prince William County, Virginia. The Union army to a long time to prepare, which allowed the Confederate Army to receive more soldiers via railway. There was approximately 18,000 soldiers on each side, who were poorly trained. During the battle, Thomas Jackson realized the Union was about to break their lines, he order his troops to charge the Union Army, where they overran their line and captured their weapons, which allowed the Confederate army to gain a victory. This battle was a wake-up call to both sides, and they realized they would need better trained soldiers.</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="content"><h4>March 8-9, 1862</h4><h3>Battle of Hampton Roads</h3><p>The battle of hampton roads was one of the most important naval battles in the civil war. This battle was an effort by the Confederate Army trying to break the Union Blockade. The reason this battle was important was because this was the first battle between two ironclads. An ironclad is a steam powered warship the is protected with either iron or steel armor, hence the name. They were developed because wooden ships were far easier to damage and sink, as wood is far less durable than iron and steel. This battle demonstrated the power of ironclad warships, and caused a drastic change in the production of naval warships, from wooden to ironclads. The attack by the Confederacy however, was unsuccessful, as the battle resulted in a draw.</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="content"><h4>September 17, 1862</h4><h3>Battle of Antietam</h3><p>The Battle of Antietam was the deadliest battle in US military history, with a total of 4,000 dead, and resulted in a union victory. The battle was significant because Lincoln was waiting for a union victory to release the emancipation proclamation, which states that the civil was was not just to keep the south in the union, but also to end slavery. This meant that Europe, which had heard of the evils of slavery, decided not to join with the south in the war.</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="content"><h4>September 22, 1862</h4><h3>Emancipation Proclamation</h3><p>The Emancipation Proclamation was a presidential proclamation that freed over 3.5 million African Americans in the Confederacy. It gave confederate supporters 60 days to surrender, and if they didn't, they could have their slaves and property confiscated. The proclamation told everyone that war wasn't just to keep the south in the Union, but also to free all the slaves in America. Slaves were freed immediately in areas which were occupied by the Union. However, states that were not a part of the rebellion were not effected by the Emancipation Proclamation.</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="content"><h4>July 1-3, 1863</h4><h3>Battle of Gettysburg</h3><p>The Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil War.
